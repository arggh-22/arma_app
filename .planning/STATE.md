# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 phases (coarse granularity) — Foundation → Engine → Subscriptions → Advanced
- Roadmap: Phase 2 (VPN Engine) is highest-risk — Xray-core AAR + VpnService + MethodChannel three-runtime bridge
- Roadmap: Hysteria2 deferred to Phase 4 (UDP/QUIC protocol, less critical than TCP-based protocols for launch)
- Roadmap: hive_ce (Community Edition) for storage, NOT original abandoned Hive

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 risk: Android 14+ foreground service `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` permission needs verification
- Phase 2 risk: Go-Mobile AAR build fragility — exact Go/gomobile/NDK version lock-step required
- Phase 2 risk: VpnService shutdown ordering (`stopSelf()` before `mInterface.close()`) is critical
